{"feedback": [{"positive": "You accurately described the core principle of KNN, highlighting its simplicity and versatility for both classification and regression.", "negative": "You could elaborate on the 'future space' concept. While intuitive, clarifying its meaning would strengthen your explanation.", "review": ["Distance metrics in KNN", "How KNN handles high-dimensional data"]}, {"positive": "You correctly identified KNN as a supervised learning algorithm.", "negative": "You didn't mention the importance of labeled data for training KNN. This is crucial for the algorithm to learn the relationships between features and target values.", "review": ["Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning", "Training and Testing Data in Machine Learning"]}]}
