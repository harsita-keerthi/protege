# Protégé

## Overview
**Protégé** is an AI-powered platform designed to enhance learning through teaching. Users create lessons on various topics and explain them to the AI, which provides real-time feedback and suggestions for improvement. This interactive approach reinforces understanding and deepens knowledge retention.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the **protégé effect**, where teaching others strengthens one's own understanding, Protégé aims to empower users to actively learn by explaining concepts to an AI model.

## Features
- **Lesson Creation**: Users can prompt the model to generate lessons based on topics.
- **Teaching Mode**: Users "teach" the AI by explaining concepts verbally.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The AI evaluates responses and provides constructive suggestions.
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Future versions will offer customized lesson plans based on user performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-End**: Built using the **Reflex framework** for a seamless user experience.
- **Back-End**: Integrated AI models for lesson generation and evaluation.
- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizes **Deepgram** for accurate real-time speech-to-text conversion.
